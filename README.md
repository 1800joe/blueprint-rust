# Rust Blueprint for Noop

This repsitory contains a Noop Blueprint and code to get started using the [Actix web framework](https://actix.rs) for Rust.

The Blueprint at [.noop/app.yml](./.noop/app.yml) builds and runs an optimized production release from [src/main.rs](./src/main.rs)

# Run locally

Running the API locally requires [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) then starting it with `cargo run`.
